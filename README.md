# SunoikisisDC
An international consortium of Digital Classics programs

<a href="http://wp.chs.harvard.edu/sunoikisis/">Sunoikisis</a> is a successful national consortium of Classics programs developed by the Harvardâ€™s <a href="http://chs.harvard.edu/">Center for Hellenic Studies</a>. The goal is to extend Sunoikisis to a global audience and contribute to it with an international consortium of Digital Classics programs (Sunoikisis DC). Sunoikisis DC is based at the <a href="http://www.dh.uni-leipzig.de/wo/">Alexander von Humboldt Chair of Digital Humanities</a> at the University of Leipzig. The aim is to offer collaborative courses that foster interdisciplinary paradigms of learning. Master students of both the humanities and computer science are welcome to join the courses and work together by contributing to digital classics projects in a collaborative environment.
